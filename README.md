## 🎯 Problem Statement

Support teams often miss early warning signs of customer dissatisfaction spreading across multiple channels. By the time they notice patterns in negative feedback, brand reputation may already be damaged. 

**SentinelAI solves this by:**
- Aggregating feedback from Twitter, reviews, forums, email, and chat
- Using AI to detect sentiment and urgency in real-time
- Auto-suggesting appropriate responses to speed up support
- Highlighting trending issues before they escalate

---

### 2. **AI-Powered Sentiment Analysis**
- Detects positive 😊, neutral 😐, and negative 😡 sentiment

- 📦 **Delivery Delay**: "Sorry your order was delayed 😔. We'll check immediately and get back to you."
- 🔒 **Fraud/Security**: "We take these concerns seriously. Our security team has been notified 🔒."

### 5. **Trend Detection**
